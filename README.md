I am a fast-learner, also adetermined and devoted person. I am fascinated in tinkering, acquiring knowledge in new fields, by helping me improve my skills and abilities thriving to bring out the best in me.

Being a very curious person, I am eager to look for solutions and problem-solving, as I thrive to overcome the problems upfront and achieve my tasks and goals.

In my spare time, I love reading books, drawing by hand or computer, photography, competitive gun and bow shooting and also karaoke. I am keen on making friends and meeting new people.

My inspiration comes from the good people and friends around me, who are good and kind, to bring out the best out of me, to give love and respect and help those in need.

Quotes that describe well my life:

“As engineers, we were going to be in a position to change the world – not just study it.”
—Henry Petroski, American engineer and author specializing in failure analysis

“Engineering stimulates the mind. Kids get bored easily. They have got to get out and get their hands dirty: make things, dismantle things, fix things. When the schools can offer that, you'll have an engineer for life. “ -Bruce Dickinson

The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall. -Nelson Mandela

“Experience life in all possible ways: good-bad, bitter-sweet, dark-light, summer-winter. Experience all the dualities. Don't be afraid of experience, because the more experience you have, the more mature you become.” -Osho
